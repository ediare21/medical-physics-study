# ðŸ©» Medical Physics Self-Study (2025â€“2027)

**Description:**  
This repository documents my **two-year, structured self-study in Medical Physics**.  
I am pivoting from 15+ years as a Physics Teacher into **Medical Physics** with the goal of becoming job-ready for the **NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP)**, MSc/PhD entry, or Assistant Physicist/Technologist roles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Build a **solid foundation** in medical physics using **free and open resources**.  
- Develop a **portfolio of 6â€“8 artifacts** (dose calculations, imaging analysis, QA plans, DICOM tools).  
- Align learning outcomes with **HCPC Clinical Scientist standards** and **IPEM guidance**.  
- Be prepared to apply for the **STP, MSc, or PhD** by 2027.
