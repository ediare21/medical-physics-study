# medical-physics-study
A two-year, free-resources self-study plan for Medical Physics.
**Schedule:** 2h Saturday (theory) + 2h Sunday (lab).

## Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.10+, Jupyter, and packages: `pip install pydicom SimpleITK scikit-image numpy matplotlib`
2. Install 3D Slicer and OHIF viewer.
3. Use `syllabus-checklist.md` to track weekly progress.

## Portfolio
Final artifacts live in `/08-Portfolio`. Each artifact folder should contain:
- a short README (what/why/how)
- data or links to open datasets (e.g., TCIA)
- notebooks/scripts and outputs (images/PDF)
